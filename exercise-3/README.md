# Exercise-3

As described in [chapter-5](https://info201-s17.github.io/book/introduction-to-git-and-github.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# git add

The command `**git add**` transfers the file or files of the project to the staging area.

Examples
```git
git add "myfile"

git add .

```
1. Add must be followed by  
.. The name of the file that you want to put in the staging area.   
.. A dot that  means all the files. 
2. Once the files are in the staging area, you must commit the changes with the command git commit.
